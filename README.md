# odin-recipes

The objective of this project is to build a basic recipe website.

The skills I will use are:

1. Drafting a boilerplate for each of my websites pages.
2. Using paragraphs, headings, bold and italics in text.
3. Creating unordered or ordered lists.
4. Using links and images for recipes.
